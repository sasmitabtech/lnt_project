"Wanderlust Diaries" represents a well-structured, responsive travel blog website, built using HTML and CSS. The HTML file is organized into clear sections including a header, a featured article section, a content area with recent posts and a sidebar, and a footer. The header uses Flexbox to align the logo and navigation links horizontally with consistent styling. The featured section showcases a highlighted blog post using a full-width image and a descriptive text block, styled with a soft green-themed background for visual emphasis. Below that, the main content area is divided into two parts: the "Recent Posts" section, which utilizes CSS Grid to display travel posts in a responsive card-based layout, and the sidebar, which includes an author bio and categorized links. Each blog post card includes an image, title, brief description, and a "Read More" link with hover effects for interactivity.

The CSS complements the structure with a nature-inspired color palette dominated by greens (#2b5d34, #3e7d4b) and clean, white backgrounds for readability. Cards and content blocks are styled with borders, padding, and hover transitions to enhance user engagement. Images throughout the site are made fully responsive by using width: 100% and height: auto. The footer is divided into two primary areas: an Instagram-style image gallery using CSS Grid, and a newsletter signup form styled for simplicity and clarity. Responsive design is handled through media queries targeting screens below 768px, where Flexbox-based layouts stack vertically and padding adjustments are made to maintain visual hierarchy.

Overall, this site demonstrates solid use of semantic HTML5 and modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid to achieve a clean, functional, and mobile-friendly blog layoutrepresents a well-structured, responsive travel blog website suitable for a travel content platform
